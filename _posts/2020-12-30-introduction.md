## **Overview**

HUAWEI Scene Kit is a lightweight 3D graphics rendering service provided by Huawei. You can easily access this Kit by integrating its SDK/Full-SDK. Then you can load and display complicated 3D objects on Android phones as desired by calling necessary APIs. To meet your different requirements on 3D rendering capabilities in various scenes, Scene Kit provides three types of views: 
**SceneView** for common scenes (non-AR), 
**ARView** for common AR scenes, and 
**FaceView** for face-specific AR scenes.



### **What Will You Create**

In this codelab, you will integrate Scene Kit and use the demo project to experience 3D rendering capabilities that Scene Kit provides for different scenes. The capabilities include:

<ul class="checklist">
    <li>In face-specific AR scenes, Scene Kit detects and identifies human faces and place 3D objects on specified part of the face.</li>
    <li>In common AR scenes, Scene Kit detects planes in real-life environments and brings virtual objects to the planes. The Kit also allows you to select the objects and move, resize, and rotate them.</li>
</ul>

**What you will learn** 
-----------------------

In this codelab, you will learn how to:

<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Integrate the SDK/Full-SDK of Scene Kit.</li>
	<li>Use FaceView to place 3D objects to parts of face.</li>
	<li>Use ARView to load and display 3D materials.</li>
</ul>
